# Contributing to the Smart Mirror

Everybody is invited and welcome to contribute to the Smart Mirror. There is a lot to do...if you are not a developer perhaps you would like to help with the documentation on [smart-mirror.io](http://smart-mirror.io/)? If you are a developer and have a feature/capability you'd like to see, why not spent a couple of hours and help build it? 

The process is straight-forward.

 - Fork Smart Mirror [git repository](https://github.com/evancohen/smart-mirror).
 - Write the code for your feature/capability.
 - Create a Pull Request against the [**dev**](https://github.com/evancohen/smart-mirror/tree/dev) branch of the Smart Mirror.
